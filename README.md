# Spark app with Dockerised tests

This is an example of multi-module spark application written in Scala/SBT. 

Playing around with [docker-it-scala](https://github.com/whisklabs/docker-it-scala) to write integration tests with Spark docker container and dockerised AWS services using [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) which provides neat mocks for AWS services.
